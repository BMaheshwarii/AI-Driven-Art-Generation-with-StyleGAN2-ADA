AI-Driven Art Generation: Leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Creative Visual Arts
Harnessing GAN technology to automatically generate creative visual artwork.

This project proposes the development of an AI system designed to create artistic visuals through GANs. 

The system will:

• Accept user-specified themes (such as “futuristic cityscape” or “abstract nature”) or stylistic choices (like “Impressionism”) as input.

• Employ a GAN model to produce original visual artwork aligned with the provided input.

• Be trained on a broad and varied dataset encompassing different art movements and themes to generate diverse outputs.

• Include an interactive web-based platform allowing users to specify preferences and instantly generate AI-produced art.
